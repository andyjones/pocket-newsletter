Hi everyone,

Here are some of the links I found interesting this week. It is Re:Invent but I haven't seen many AWS announcements. The week has been dominated by [Timnit Gebru's resignation from Google](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/5/22155985/paper-timnit-gebru-fired-google-large-language-models-search-ai). I'm surprised by the number of strong opinions that condemn one side or the other.

Thanks!

Andy
